# lil_slr_light_meter
A SLR (35mm film) camera has a broken light meter. There are some phone apps that are not too acurate, so taking the 
problem on in a DIY kind of way seemed like a good project. 
Three part are: 
  1. (/arduino/) the microprossesor electronics including sensors, buttons, 7 segment display, li-poly battery with charging board and light sensor.
  2. (/case/) the case, a 3D printed with some some faseners
  3. (/state_diagram/) a state diagram of the light meter defines UI and actions
(images of the making are coming soon)
